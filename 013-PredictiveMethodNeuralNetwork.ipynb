The R² scores for some of the metrics are extremely low, indicating poor fit of the model to the data. The MSE and RMSE values are also relatively high for some metrics, suggesting that the model's predictions are not very close to the actual values.\n","\n","To improve the accuracy of the predictions, several recommendations can be considered:\n","1. Feature Engineering: It may be beneficial to explore additional weather features or other relevant variables that could better explain the variability in emissions metrics.\n","2. Model Tuning: Experiment with different neural network architectures, activation functions, learning rates, and regularization techniques to optimize the model's performance.\n","3. Data Preprocessing: Ensure that the data is properly scaled, normalized, and cleaned to improve the model's ability to learn patterns in the data.\n","4. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization performance and avoid overfitting.\n","5. Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to combine multiple models for improved prediction accuracy.\n","\n","Overall, while the Neural Network model shows potential for predicting emissions metrics based on weather features, further refinement and optimization are needed to enhance the accuracy of the predictions.\n"]}],"source":["# ----------------------------------\n","# 1.
