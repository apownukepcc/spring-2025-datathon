For some metrics like SO2 and CO, the predictions seem to be relatively accurate with low MSE and RMSE values. However, for metrics like NH3 and NOX, the predictions show higher errors and lower R² scores, indicating room for improvement.\n","\n","To enhance the accuracy of the predictions, you may consider the following recommendations:\n","1. Feature Engineering: Explore additional relevant features that could potentially improve the model's performance, such as historical data, emissions data, or geographical information.\n","2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the Gradient Boosting Regressor to optimize the model's performance further.\n","3. Data Preprocessing: Ensure the data is properly preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing outliers.\n","4. Model Selection: Consider trying different regression models or ensemble methods to see if they can provide better predictions for the target metrics.\n","5. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization performance and reduce overfitting.\n","\n","By implementing these recommendations and continuously refining the model, you can potentially improve the accuracy of the predictions for the target metrics.\n"]}],"source":["# ----------------------------------\n","# 1.
