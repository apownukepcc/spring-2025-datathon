For some metrics like SO2 and NOX, the model performs reasonably well with low RMSE and high R² scores. However, for NH3 and CO, the model seems to struggle with higher errors and lower R² scores.\n","\n","To improve the predictions, you could consider the following recommendations:\n","1. Feature Engineering: Explore additional features that may have a stronger correlation with the emissions metrics. This could include historical emissions data, industry activity levels, or geographical factors.\n","2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor, such as the number of estimators, max depth, and min samples split, to optimize the model's performance.\n","3. Data Preprocessing: Ensure that the data is properly preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.\n","4. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization performance and reduce overfitting.\n","5. Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost to potentially improve prediction accuracy.\n","\n","Overall, while the model shows promise in predicting some emissions metrics, there is room for improvement in terms of accuracy and generalization. By implementing the above recommendations, you may be able to enhance the model's performance and make more reliable predictions.\n"]}],"source":["# ----------------------------------\n","# 1.
