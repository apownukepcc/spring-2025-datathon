This suggests that the linear regression model may not be capturing the underlying relationships between the weather features and emissions metrics effectively.\n","\n","To improve the accuracy of the predictions, you may consider the following recommendations:\n","1. Feature Engineering: Explore additional weather features or interactions between features that may better explain the variability in emissions metrics.\n","2. Model Selection: Experiment with different regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) that may better capture non-linear relationships in the data.\n","3. Data Preprocessing: Ensure that the data is properly scaled, normalized, and any outliers are handled appropriately to improve model performance.\n","4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen regression model to improve its predictive performance.\n","5. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the generalization performance of the model and reduce overfitting.\n","\n","By implementing these recommendations and further refining the model, you may be able to enhance the accuracy of the predictions for emissions metrics.\n"]}],"source":["# ----------------------------------\n","# 1.
