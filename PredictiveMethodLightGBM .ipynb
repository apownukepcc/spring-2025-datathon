For example, the model performs relatively well for SO2 and CO emissions, with low RMSE and MAE values. However, for NH3 and NOX emissions, the model shows higher errors and lower RÂ² scores, indicating room for improvement.\n","\n","To enhance the predictive performance, several recommendations can be considered:\n","1. Feature Engineering: Explore additional relevant features that could potentially improve the model's predictive power, such as historical emissions data, industry activity levels, or geographical factors.\n","2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the LightGBM Regressor to optimize the model's performance.\n","3. Data Preprocessing: Ensure data quality by addressing missing values, outliers, and scaling the features appropriately to enhance the model's robustness.\n","4. Model Evaluation: Consider using cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability and stability across different subsets of the data.\n","5. Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble techniques, such as stacking or blending multiple models, to potentially boost predictive accuracy.\n","\n","Overall, while the current model shows promising results for some metrics, there is still room for improvement, and implementing the above recommendations could help enhance the accuracy of the predictions.\n"]}],"source":["# ----------------------------------\n","# 1.
